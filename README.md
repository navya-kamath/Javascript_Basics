# JavaScript-Learning

Welcome to the **JavaScript-Learning** repository! This is a personal project to practice and document my journey of learning JavaScript from scratch. The repository is organized into folders based on key concepts and topics.


## Repository Structure

The repository includes the following folders:

1. **Basics**  
   Foundational JavaScript concepts like variables, objects and their methods, arrays and their methods, and operators.

2. **Conditional_n_ControlStatement**  
   Examples and exercises on `if-else` statements, `for-loop`, `while-loop`, `do-while-loop`, `for-in-loop`, and `for-of-loop`.

3. **Functions**  
   Understanding function declaration, expressions, and hoisting.

4. **ES6**  
   Problem with `var`, including `let`/`const`, arrow functions, template-literal and multi-line strings, destructuring arrays and objects, modules and modularity.

5. **Functional_programming**  
   Core principles of functional programming with examples in JavaScript.

6. **OOP**  
   Object-oriented programming concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.
